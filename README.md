This task is to help you use all the widgets we will discuss this week. You are to Create the screen in a scaffold, without an app bar and with the following widgets:
 

Scaffold.
Column.
Containers.
Text fields.
Buttons.
Texts.
Image.
There should also be a button to navigate to another screen called the signup screen. The layout should be an image at the top (you can use any image that looks like an app icon), the text fields underneath then the buttons.
